/**
 * Extract Matches
So far, you have only been checking if a pattern exists or not within a string. You can also extract the actual matches you found with the .match() method.

To use the .match() method, apply the method on a string and pass in the regex inside the parentheses.

Here's an example:

"Hello, World!".match(/Hello/);
let ourStr = "Regular expressions";
let ourRegex = /expressions/;
ourStr.match(ourRegex);
Here the first match would return ["Hello"] and the second would return ["expressions"].

Note that the .match syntax is the "opposite" of the .test method you have been using thus far:

'string'.match(/regex/);
/regex/.test('string');
 */

let extractStr = "Extract the word 'coding' from this string.";
let codingRegex = /coding/; // Change this line
let result = extractStr.match(codingRegex); // Change this line

// To search or extract a pattern more than once, you can use the g flag.

let twinkleStar = "Twinkle, twinkle, little star";
let starRegex = /Twinkle/gi; // Change this line
let result = twinkleStar.match(starRegex); // Change this line

// The wildcard character . will match any one character. The wildcard is also called dot and period. You can use the wildcard character just 
// like any other character in the regex. For example, if you wanted to match hug, huh, hut, and hum, you can use the regex /hu./ to match all four words.

let exampleStr = "Let's have fun with regular expressions!";
let unRegex = /.un/; // Change this line
let result = unRegex.test(exampleStr);

let quoteSample = "Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.";
let vowelRegex = /[aeiou]/gi; // Change this line
let result = quoteSample.match(vowelRegex); // Change this line
